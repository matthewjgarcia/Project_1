## Coffee Chronicles: Brewing Health or Harm?

As coffee lovers ourselves, we were curious to see if there is any correlation between the amount of coffee we drink and our overall health. So, this project identified the average amount of coffee consumed for multiple populations, and compared that to various health issues that are present in those populations according to the CDC. 

According to our calculations, there is in fact a positive statistical significance the amount of coffee consumed and overall health problems such as insomnia, tobacco addiction, heart disease, and mental health issues. One exception seems to be alcoholism, which cannot be proven to be related to the amount of coffee consumed. 

Although these calculations show a positive statistical significance between coffee consumption and overall health, there are still many other factors that contribute to the overall health levels of the observed populations that were not considered.

## Dataset Information

The health datasets used in this project are from the CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which contains information on a plethora of health issues from different populations and demographics.These were used to analyze health factors possibly affected by coffee consumption.
